# Setup

As ScriptsOfTribute Engine is based on the .NET framework, we recommend using Windows as a developing platform. 


## Step 1: Download the engine

You can download the source code of the SoT engine from [this repository](https://github.com/ScriptsOfTribute/ScriptsOfTribute-Core).


## Step 2: Choose your IDE

Any you like. If you choose Visual Studio, make sure that you choose Visual Studio 2022, which supports .NET 8.


## Step 3: .NET SDK 

*Skip this if you've chosen Visual Studio.*

To build our engine and create bots with it, you need to install .NET 8 SDK compatible with your operating system. Go to the official page [Download .NET 8.0](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/8.0), download, and then install the latest version.

If you are using Linux - here is the [link](https://tecadmin.net/how-to-install-dotnet-core-on-ubuntu-22-04) to the tested tutorial; just change the version in commands from 6.0 to 8.0.


# Implementing AI Agent

## Important Classes 

You should familiarize yourself with them before implementing a bot.

1. [AI.cs](https://github.com/ScriptsOfTribute/ScriptsOfTribute-Core/blob/master/Engine/src/AI/AI.cs) - abstract class from which your agent should inherit. You have to implement the `SelectPatron` and `Play` methods. In the `EndGame` method, you can add code that should be run after the end of the game, and in `Log` method you can add some logs.

2. All files in [Serializers](https://github.com/ScriptsOfTribute/ScriptsOfTribute-Core/tree/master/Engine/src/Serializers) folder - by using these classes you can gain access to all visible data of the game - board, hand, tavern, etc. You can start with the `GameState` class - the object of this class you get from the `Play` method. 

Useful files if you want to get access to some important information (cost of a card, amount of power of the opponent, ...) and types of cards, effects, etc:

3. [Move.cs](https://github.com/ScriptsOfTribute/ScriptsOfTribute-Core/blob/master/Engine/src/Board/Move.cs)
4. [Card.cs](https://github.com/ScriptsOfTribute/ScriptsOfTribute-Core/blob/master/Engine/src/Board/Cards/Card.cs)
5. [Agent.cs](https://github.com/ScriptsOfTribute/ScriptsOfTribute-Core/blob/master/Engine/src/Board/Cards/Agent.cs)
6. [UniqueEffects.cs](https://github.com/ScriptsOfTribute/ScriptsOfTribute-Core/blob/master/Engine/src/Board/Cards/UniqueEffect.cs)

## Overview of Important Objects
This section introduces some objects that are used in the engine and knowing them is important for understanding other sections.
- `EndGameState` – contains information about how the game ended. It has a `Reason` field that indicates why the game ended, which can, for example, be `TURN_TIMEOUT` or `INCORRECT_MOVE`. It also contains `ID` of the winning player (unless the game ended to a reason such as an internal failure) and a string containing additional context about why the game ended, for example, in case of an incorrect move, it contains the move and a list of all other correct moves that were possible and should have been played instead. API functions often return `EndGameState?` – in most cases it is null, but in case the player makes a mistake or his move ends the game, this object is returned to indicate this.
- `Move` – represents a move that a player can make. It contains a `Type` field, which can be, for example, `PLAY_CARD`, `END_TURN`, or `ACTIVATE_PATRON`. Depending on the type, it also contains additional information, such as the card that is to be played in case of `PLAY_CARD` move. Moves can be created using static methods in `Move` class, for example: `Move.PlayCard(card)`.
- `Choice` – represents a choice that the player has to make. It can be, for example, a choice of which card to discard. Either cards or effects can be chosen, depending on the card played. This object also contains some information about the choice, including all possible items to choose, how many items need to be chosen, or what the effect of the choice will trigger (for example: destroy the chosen cards).
- `ChoiceContext` – this object lives inside the `Choice` and holds additional context, including the card and effect, or the patron that triggered the choice.

## Creating a Bot

1. You can either download `dll` library file from [here](https://github.com/ScriptsOfTribute/ScriptsOfTribute-Core/releases) and use it as normal .NET library or you can clone engine repository and create a file in `ScriptsOfTribute-Core\Bots\src` folder e.g. `MyFirstAgent.cs`. 
Please remember that your class (in this case, `MyFirstAgent`) should inherit from AI abstract class.

2. Implement the body of `SelectPatron` method.
Arguments of this method are a list of available patrons and which round of selection of patron it is (first or second). Your method should return `Enum` object of the type `PatronId`.

3. Implement a body of `Play` method
This method will be run in a loop until you don't return a move that will end your turn, or your bot will try to do not allowed move. The method receives a `GameState` and a list of possible moves and should return one move from that list.

4. [Optional] Implement the body of GameEnd
This method is called after the game has ended. The purpose
of this function is to allow the programmer to analyze the data from the `EndGameState` object as they wish.

5. [Optional] Add logs
To add logs to your bot, call the method `Log` with a string that you want to put in your log. Logs can be shown in the GUI during play.

6. Compile your bot: \
In case you use our engine through `dll` file just compile your project as library, but if you work inside the reposity just run `dotnet build` in `ScriptsOfTribute-Core\Bots` folder. 
Created `dll` file is now ready to use either by GameRunner or GUI app.

## External Language

### gRPC
Our engine supports gRPC connection for external languages. For now we've prepared Python [pip package](https://pypi.org/project/scripts-of-tribute/) that covers whole communication, for details please check repository with the [source code](https://github.com/ScriptsOfTribute/ScriptsOfTribute-Python) and provided examples there on how to use this library.

### **OBSOLETE** Communication via standart input/output
There's a possibility to use different language than C# to create a bot thanks to [ExternalAIAdadpter](https://github.com/ScriptsOfTribute/ScriptsOfTribute-Core/blob/master/Engine/src/AI/ExternalAIAdapter.cs). For now engine is built to work with Python files, but enabling other languages is easy. In such cases please contact us.
If you plan to create a bot in different language you have to parse game state from stdin which will come in json format ending with EOT string as an "End of Transmission" sign. Forming this object is done in [Game State class](https://github.com/ScriptsOfTribute/ScriptsOfTribute-Core/blob/master/Engine/src/Serializers/GameState.cs) in `SerializeGameState` method. To understand more how these objects look please check [tests](https://github.com/ScriptsOfTribute/ScriptsOfTribute-Core/blob/master/Tests/utils/JSONSerializeTests.cs). In case of any problem fastest way to get help or any information is through our [discord](https://discord.gg/RSZjNHuHGm).

## Example Agents

Feel free to study our [example agents](https://github.com/ScriptsOfTribute/ScriptsOfTribute-Core/tree/master/Bots/src), to familiarize yourself more with the infrastructure of the project. You can also use code from them to create your own code. 

Bots whose understanding can help you implement your own agents:
1. [RandomBot](https://github.com/ScriptsOfTribute/ScriptsOfTribute-Core/blob/master/Bots/src/RandomBot.cs)
2. [MaxPrestigeBot](https://github.com/ScriptsOfTribute/ScriptsOfTribute-Core/blob/master/Bots/src/MaxPrestigeBot.cs) Focus on the usage of `gameState.ApplyMove()` - this function allows you to simulate a move. If you provide a seed, you can simulate a random playout based on that seed. When running this method without a seed you will receive `GameState` and available moves without any random events (like a card that you could draw, a new card in the tavern after buying/removing the card, etc.)


## Console Game Runner 

Game Runner is a command-line application that allows the user to load bots from DLLs and run games between them.

Usage: `GameRunner <NameOfBot1> <NameOfBot2> <flags>`
for example: `GameRunner RandomBot RandomBot -n 1000 -t 2` will run 1000 games between two `RandomBot`s using two threads

For more flags and usage help, run `GameRunner -h`

To run game with bot made in different language, for example python via gRPC use `grpc:` before bot's name. For example: `GameRunner RandomBot grpc:RandomBot -n 1000 -t 2`

It is available for download [here](https://github.com/ScriptsOfTribute/ScriptsOfTribute-Core/releases) for Windows, Linux and MacOS
